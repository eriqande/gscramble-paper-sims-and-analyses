This repo holds all the code for reproducing the simulations, analyses, and
figures from the paper, "Title still not determined" by Authors, Authors,
Authors, about the R package 'gscramble'.  

It is set up to be relatively reproducible.  Running it all the way we
did requires Snakemake.  

The R packages for this are maintained by the 'renv' package.  So, run it with
R version 4.2.0 (2022-04-22), and do these steps:

1. Open the RStudio project.
2. Issue `renv::restore()` in the console.
3. Activate your snakemake environment in your Unix terminal
4. Do `snakemake --use-conda --cores 8` to use 8 cores.  Set the number of cores
as appropriate to your system.


## Notes:

To run this on Sedna, I did this:
```sh
module load R/4.0.3
R

# and when it started it bootstrapped renv together and then
# in R I did:
renv::restore()

# that took a while, because it built a lot of it from source
# on Linux, but eventually got done.

# then I gave a test run (2 reps for each condition) with:
snakemake --cores 20 --use-conda --use-envmodules results/compiled/Q-values-from-sims.tsv.gz
